FFB production is 14% above budget, and the cost of production is 22% below budget. Key management focuses include eliminating noxious weeds, completing the delayed manuring program, and managing the aggressive replanting schedule for Fields 2025. Vehicle running costs for specific tractors remain a concern due to high repair costs. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 50-51)",
                        "Area Statement": "The total planted area stands at 1,520.82 ha. The mature area has been reduced to 1,289.58 ha following the replanting of 101.58 ha (Fields 1998C/D, 2000B). The immature area has increased to 231.24 ha, comprising Fields 2025 A-G. Future replanting is scheduled for 179.60 ha in FY 2026/27 and 102.30 ha in FY 2027/28. Watermelon intercropping is in progress on 59.03 ha of the replanting area. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 10-11)",
                        "Labour Statement": "The estate employs 114 workers (Checkroll), achieving a worker-to-land ratio of 1:13 ha, which is considered adequate. There is a shortage of 14 workers against the requirement of 128. Harvester strength is 53 (1:24 ha). Harvesting and collection in Fields 2018 and 2020 (239.88 ha) have been successfully contracted out. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 12-13)",
                        "Staff Establishment": "The estate is managed by Senior Manager En. Mohamed Rezal Bin Bakal. The Senior Assistant Manager post is vacant following a resignation. There is a shortage of 2 Field Conductors, which is critical given the aggressive replanting activities. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 15-16)",
                        "General Charges": "Total expenditure was RM 1,179,835 (RM 776/ha), which is 9% below the seasonal budget. Significant overspending noted in Staff Welfare (493% above budget due to training) and Computer Maintenance (63% above budget). (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 17-19)",
                        "Upkeep & Cultivation": "Total upkeep cost was RM 1,022.99/ha (27% below budget). Weeding: Circle spraying is 51% complete. Manuring: Only 39% of the annual program complete. Pest Control: Bagworm treatment cost exceeded budget significantly due to past infections. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 20-39)",
                        "Harvesting and Collection": "Total cost is RM 83.05/MT, 11% below the budget. Infield loading cost is 30% below budget. Mechanization using Mini Tractor Grabbers (MTG) is effective, with harvester productivity at 3.53 MT/man-day. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 40-43)",

                        "Production Cost": "The ex-estate cost of production stands at RM 246.11/MT, significantly lower (22%) than the seasonal budget of RM 316.78/MT. This favorable variance is driven by higher-than-budgeted crop production and savings in upkeep costs. (Source: PA 2/2025, Pg. 45)",

Weeding in immature areas is slow. Pest control is a major concern with extensive rat damage (36% infestation) and persistent Ganoderma. Yield performance improved by 2% year-on-year. (Source: Agro Rep 1/2026, Pg. 4-8)",
                        "Nutrient inputs progress of manuring": "As of Nov 2025, manuring is behind schedule. The Rock Phosphate (RP) program is pending for mature/immature areas. NK Mixture 2nd round is pending. Compost application completed in P01, P02, P05, and P18, but nutrient analysis of compost is lacking. (Source: Agro Rep 1/2026, Pg. 16-23)",

This resulted in an estimated wastage of ~RM 59,000. (Source: Audit Ref 05/26, Pg. 3-8)",
