Crop production reached 21,346.72 MT (14.02 MT/ha), exceeding the budget by 18%. Production costs were controlled at RM 224.29/MT, 14% below budget. However, operational delays were noted in manuring (only 40% complete) and weeding programs. The estate is also dealing with a labour shortage of 27 workers. <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 8, 41-43)</span>",

Unplanted areas include 89.64 ha of roads and 7.02 ha of buildings/orchards. There are no replanting plans for the next two financial years. <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 10)</span>",
                        "Labour Statement": "The total workforce stands at 102, which is 27 workers short of the requirement (129). The current land-to-labour ratio is 1:15 ha, considered slightly inadequate. Recruitment of 27 new workers is in progress. Harvester strength (including pruners) is 60, with a ratio of 1:25 ha, supported by mechanized infield collection. <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 11)</span>",
                        "Staff Establishment": "The staff establishment is largely satisfactory. The estate is managed by Senior Manager Ts. Mohamed Rezal Bin Bakal, supported by a new Cadet Assistant, Ong Pei Qi. However, two vacancies for Field Conductors remain unfilled and should be prioritized. Administrative staff are shared with Bukit Senorang Estate. <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 13)</span>",
                        "General Charges": "Total expenditure was RM 606.87/ha, 3% below the seasonal budget of RM 628.24. Labour overheads exceeded the budget by 4% (RM 252.14/ha) due to higher headcount. Significant overspending was noted in Staff Welfare (736% over due to unbudgeted training) and Insurance/Road Tax (63% over). <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 14-15)</span>",
                        "Upkeep Cultivation": "Overall upkeep cost was RM 1,430.30/ha (Budget: RM 1,466.32). Weeding is delayed, with circle spraying only 31% complete (0.9 rounds) and selective spraying 60% complete. Manuring is critically delayed at 40% completion due to supplier stock issues. Composting is 54% complete, though costs are high (RM 312.22/ha) due to increased application rates (20 MT/ha). P&D costs include bagworm treatment (RM 22.73/ha) and ongoing Ganoderma mounding. <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 17-27)</span>",
                        "Harvesting and Collection": "Total harvesting cost is RM 79.04/tonne, 7% below the budget of RM 84.66. Harvester productivity is satisfactory at 3.06–3.38 MT/man-day, earning ~RM 90/day. However, harvesting intervals slipped to 16–23 days in October, exceeding the target of <15 days. Mechanization uses 5 mini-tractors with grabbers (1:304 ha). <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 34-36)</span>",

This favorable variance is primarily driven by the high crop volume, despite overspending in specific maintenance vehicle categories. Breakdown: General Charges RM 43.27, Upkeep RM 101.98, Harvesting RM 79.04. <span class='observation-ref'>(PA Pg. 39)</span>",
